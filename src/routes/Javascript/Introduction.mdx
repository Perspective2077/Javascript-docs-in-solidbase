# What is Javascript
Javascript is a high-level,interpreted (or [just-in-time compiled](/reference/HLL)) programming language initially developed in just ten days by Brendan Eich in 1995 to add interactivity to the [Netscape Navigator web browser](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Netscape_Navigator).

Originally, it was known by the codename `Mocha`, then briefly called `LiveScript`, before finally being renamed `JavaScript`~ to associate it with the popular Java programming language, despite having no actual relation. In 1996 Netscape submitted JavaScript to Ecma International, In 1997 it became the [ECMA-262 standard](), also known as ECMAScript.

:::details[EcmaScript]
Ecma International is a non profit standards organization who provides neutral forum (committee) for companies, academics, and experts to draft and create standards (plueprints). 
They publish documents so everyone using that technology should be build on those blueprint so everything works same as everywhere.


One example is our Javascript :
Any companies that make software around javascript like node js dino aka runtime engine's or a browser should should follow those standard defined by ecma international

"Ecma International don’t ship software themselves. They just publish documents"

Standards don’t force anyone to follow them.
They exist so vendors choose to implement the same behavior (or risk incompatibility aka go fuck yourself).

Ecmascript (known as Javascript) is one of the standard ecma international have, to be precise 262th standard some other popular standards are C# (ECMA-334), Dart (ECMA-408) and JSON (ECMA-404)

:::
Javascript was primarily used to manipulate the DOM like dynamicly update contents , form validation , handle user events and also for creating async requests.

Being created as a browser specific language only , In 2009 the [Javascript Engine](https://example.com) got extracted from browser and runtime engine node js was introduce that made javascript a Platform-independent programming language that now is being used for developing various libraries and application also

As of 2025, JavaScript remains the only programming language natively understood and executed by all web browsers , it is also one of the largest language developer use to create applications , Despite its humble beginnings, it has grown into one of the most widely used languages in the world — powering not just websites, but also mobile apps (React Native), desktop apps (Electron), games, IoT, and more.



:::details[JavaScript Creation]
Early on, Brendan Eich wanted to base JavaScript’s semantics partly on Scheme (a Lisp dialect).
Netscape originally considered embedding Scheme itself, but management pushed for a language that looked like Java because Java was hot.
As a result, JavaScript’s syntax looks like Java/C but its internals (first-class functions, closures, prototypal inheritance) still show Scheme/Lisp influence.

:::details[EcmaScript Creation]
- In Early Days , When each browser vendor was making its own version of scripting languages.
Netscape had created JavaScript, Which Microsoft quickly made a slightly incompatible copy of called JScript (1996) with for Internet Explorer because JavaScript was exploding in popularity.

- So netscape wanted to prevent Microsoft from owning the language by forking it... and also knew that they won't survive the war with Microsoft (and indeed, they didn’t,it got acquired by AOL in 1998). and the creator Eich wanted the language to survive netscape 

-Also At the time, JavaScript was seen by many as a “toy language” for making pop-ups and form validation. Submitting it to ECMA gave it legitimacy in the eyes of enterprises, tool vendors, and developers.

- Which lead to a press release in 1996 in which they said "Netscape has submitted JavaScript to ECMA International… The submission is intended to encourage widespread adoption of JavaScript and promote industry-wide specification of the language for use across multiple platforms and products". aka They asked Ecma to create a standard for the javascript

- So After that Ecma created a Technical Committee 39 (TC39) to write the spec and standardize the language.
In 1997, ECMA published the first edition of ECMA-262 (262th standard was javascript), defining ECMAScript.

- Microsoft also participated in the standardization process.
cause Both were very similar but had small incompatibilities.
so after standardization
JScript became essentially an implementation of ECMAScript, with extra proprietary bits ,
Like VBScript an custom made Windows-focused scripting language mostly used in IE and Windows automation properties not standardize by Ecmascript that later got deprecated

:::details[JavaScript and EcmaScript]
Netscape created JavaScript.
They wanted the `Java` brand for marketing ( Cause It was the hype word then).
They did a licensing deal with Sun Microsystems (the creator of Java) to use the name `JavaScript`   
- Result : Sun Microsystems owned the JavaScript word trademark, Netscape owned the language

In 2010, Oracle acquired Sun Microsystems.
That meant Oracle inherited all of Sun’s trademarks and IP — including Java and JavaScript trademarks.
that lead to lawsuit (november 2010) google for using java api in thier code bases although rules in favour of google in April 2021 cause at that time oracle wasn't hiring lawyers

So today (sept 2025):
- The word `JavaScript` is legally a trademark of Oracle Corporation means no one can use it as product today not even Ecmascript
even though The language specification (ECMAScript) is owned and maintained by Ecma International.

- The real creator today don't give a shit nor maintain javascript  

- Now Ryan Dahl (creator of Node.js and Deno) filed a petition with the U.S. Patent in which he said javascript is become generic word for Ecmascript and everyone uses it to refer to the language, implementations, and also nor oracle do any shit for javascript nor they released anyshit for javascript as a product

- In which oracle didn't gave a shit and didnt appeared in court also later they were forced to then they also presented the Node.js as their product (i am dead litreally) but anyway so at this time oracle started hiring lawyers and Ryan Da(i)hl lost the case 

- but anyway the point was to allow people/orgs could freely (now had to use as Ecmascript to be in "fair use of javascript word" ) use the name `JavaScript” (for products, conferences, books, etc.) without fear Oracle might come after them (google lawsuit)
although oracle didnt lawsuit anyway till now but again .. corpo shit you never know when it's your last day

# How to run Javascript
1.just press f12 in browser and in the console you can type javascript and press enter but only a single line shell <br/>
2. use a javascript playground https://playcode.io/new  <br/>
3. run locally . download node js then type node "your file" and it gonna get executed
