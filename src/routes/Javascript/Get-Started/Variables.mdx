# Variables and Constants

To store values like text or numbers , we can declare variables and Constants   
As the name says variables to store values that going to change in future and constants that cannot be changed

## Constant
To make a constant we use `const` keyword followed by the constants name , equal and it's value  
```js
const pi = 3.14
```
Now the value `pi` cannot be changed in future
Commonly used when you want to store fixed values (eg. company name)

## Variables
Now Variables can be declared by two ways , either using `let` or `var`
```js
var year = 2025
```

```js
let month = 03
```
The difference is You CANNOT re-declare a `let` variable in the same scope   
means
```js
let month = 03
let month = 03  // error
```
but you can do
```js
var year = 2025
var year = 2025  // valid
```
Now you don't use var most time in javascript cause it remove the concept of `scope`


## scopes in Javascript
In Javascript you can create your own bubble(scope) inside a single file like for 
Scope in javascript is used to create a layer between variables that block parent from accessing it's variable  
```js
    /* main bubble*/
{   /* second bubble */
  { /* third bubble */ }
}
```
ex. second third bubble here can access any variable created in main bubble
but main bubble can't access it's childs (second third ) bubbles variable..

Example : 

```js
let car = "nano"
  
  { 
     let bike = "splender"  
     
       {  
        let cycle = "atlas"  
        console.log(car) // nano
        console.log(bike) // splender 
        console.log(cycle) // atlas
       }

      console.log(car) // nano
      console.log(bike) // splender 
      console.log(cycle) // error.. cycle is not defined
  }

console.log(car) // nano
console.log(bike) // error.. car is not defined
console.log(cycle) // error.. cycle is not defined
```
Now the second room can't access the third room but any nested can access the main room
The directory is reverse here 
like sub room can access it's parent but parent can't access them



Like forth room person can access third and main cointainers water but main container man can't access any water
