## Model
So model in mongodb is used for creating the data , schema is the blueprint we use to define the structure and model is what we use to create data out of that blueprint
## Creating a model
To create model we have .model() method from mongoose
```js 
  let dbModel = mongoose.model("modelName",schemaObject)
```
example : 
```js
let {moongose} from "./index.ts"
// userSchema
let userModel = mongoose.model("Users",userSchema)

export {userModel}
```

## Creating Data using Model
So there are two methods you can create the data in models  
first .create() method
```js
const user = await userModel.create({
    username : "yellow",
    email : "yellow@yahoo"
})

console.log(user) // returned created data
```
using .save() method
```js
const user = new userModel({
    username : "yellow",
    email : "yellow@yahoo"
})

await user.save() 
```
