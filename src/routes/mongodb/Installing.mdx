## Installing mongodb
First of all there are two different words ```mongoose``` and ```mongodb`` , mongodb is the database we using and mongoose is the library we using to connect our database to backend i.e. express js for example    
Although mongodb give it's own native library i.e
```npm i mongodb```
but this is raw driver and doesnt have much features as mongoose also to note mongoose is build on top of mongodb's native library so it have all the features mongodb have + extra features.
 
```js
npm i mongoose
```
