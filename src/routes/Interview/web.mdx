## 3. How do you handle routing in Express? What's the difference between app.get() and router.get()?
:::details[Answer]
A compiled language is one where the source code is translated into machine code (or low-level binary) by a compiler before it’s executed. This creates an executable file that then can run directly on the computer’s hardware. Examples most languages include C, C++, and Rust.  
Because the code is pre-compiled, compiled languages typically offer faster performance and early error detection during the build step.
