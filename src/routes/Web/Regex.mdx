## Regex (Regular Expression)
A Pattern used for searching or validating text

## Brief
A regex format is 



```sql
"/pattern/flags(optional)"

pattern => how to match
flags => modifiers for matching

```
`pattern` is what we use most times for validating entries or value , `flags` are addition modifiers we can use for matching although sometimes it's not needed or accepted by languages  
example : 
```sql
pattern.test("test@email.com")
```

# Pattern
Regex Pattern expression 
```sql
/conditions/
```



## 1. Digit

```sql
\d  or [0-9]
```
Means check if text contains a digit  

```js
/\d/.test("2")  // true
```
 
## 2. operators

```sql
+  = 1 or more 
*  = 0 or more
?  = 0 or one
```  

```js
/\d+/.test("")  // false
```
```js
/\d*/.test("")  // true
```
```js
/\d?/.test("")  // true
```


(Practice Question)
```
/\d?/.test("233")
```
:::details[Answer]
 True , cause "?" means one or none , it found one 
::: 

 

## 3. square class

```sql
[]
```
Checks For Word characters or
```sql
[a-z] = for small alphabets
[A-Z] = for capital alphabets
[a-zA-Z] or [A-Za-z] = for any alphabets aka \w
```

```js
/[a-z]/.test("abc")  // true
```
 

## character class 
 ```js
\d	= digit [0-9]
\D	= non-digit
\w	= word char [A-Za-z0-9_]
\W	= non-word
.	= any char (except newline unless s)
 ```

 
## 4. Special characters
To specify speicial character you use `\`   
```sql
\* = match * in the text
\@ = match @ in the text
```
But they are only used for either specified keywords (w for words , d for digits) or mentioning special characters



## 4. Anchors || Exact matching
```sql
^ condition  $
```
This means entire string must match this pattern — nothing extra before or after .. also like validating  
so if you do like
```js
/^\d+$/.test("2323asd") // false , cause char included
```

(Practice Question)
```js
/^\d+\w*$/.test("233sd")
```
:::details[Answer]
 True , cause it have more then one digit and zero or more word char 
::: 


Important clarification (small myth)

❌ ^$ does NOT mean “validate” by itself
✅ It means “match an empty string”
```js
/^$/.test("")      // true
/^$/.test("a")     // false
```

## 5. Positive lookahead
```js
(?=condition)  : anything but include the condition in the end
(?!=condition) : anything but doesnt include the condition in the end
```
Check that something exists next, but do NOT consume it

```js
/(?=.)/.test("ok Bye.") // true 
```

## 6. Anything aka greedy wildcard
```js
.*    // matches everything 
```
dot means any character so adding star makes it matches anything of any size   
usally used with lookahead example 
```js
/^.*\.$/.test("ok Bye.")  // true ,  cause it means match everything with a dot in the end
```


## Negated character class aka everything except
```js
[^items]   // everything except items in the box
```
example 
```js
/^[^0-9]+$/.test("ok Bye.")  // true , cause it want everything that is atleast one and not a digit between 0-9
```


## White space characters

| Pattern | Name                                   |
| ------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `space` | literal space                          |
| `\s`    | whitespace (space, tab, newline, etc.) |
| `\S`    | non-whitespace                         |
| `\t`    | tab                                    |
| `\n`    | newline                                |
| `\r`    | carriage return                        |
| `\f`    | form feed                              |
| `\v`    | vertical tab                           |




## exact counts
```js
{n}     = exactly n times
{n,}    = at least n times
{n,m}   = between n and m times

```
so 4 example 
```js
^\d{3}$ // matches exactly 3 digit number
```

## Grouping & alternation
```js
(abc)	= capture group aka group of character as a single match
(?:abc)	= non-capturing aka grouping but doesnt remeber (advance for regex only )
\1	backreference

```




## flags
`gimsuy`
```sql
g :	how many matches
i :	case sensitivity
m :	meaning of ^ $ / multiline
s :	meaning of .
u :	character interpretation / unicode
y :	match position  / sticky
```

```sql
\d   = digit
+    = at least one
^ $  = validating (full match)

```


```sql
\d        → one digit
\d+       → one or more digits
^\d+$     → only digits, nothing else

```
